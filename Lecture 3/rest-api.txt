Rest API is basically just jules for Defining API URLs

Use Nouns, Not Verbs
  When defining routes, always use nouns to represent the resource being interacted with, rather than verbs to describe the action.
    Correct: /users
    Incorrect: /getAllUsers

Resources in REST Terminology
Each entity, such as posts, users, or todos, is referred to as a resource.

Action Determined by HTTP Method
The type of HTTP request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) determines the action to be performed on the resource. Here's how to structure the routes:

  To Create a Resource
    Correct: POST /posts
    Incorrect: POST /posts/create-post

  To Retrieve a List of Resources
    Correct: GET /posts
    Incorrect: GET /getAllPosts

  To Retrieve a Specific Resource
    Correct: GET /posts/{id}
    Incorrect: GET /getPostById/{id}

  To Update a Resource
    Correct: PUT /posts/{id}
    Incorrect: PUT /updatePost/{id}

  To Delete a Resource
    Correct: DELETE /posts/{id}
    Incorrect: DELETE /deletePost/{id}
